## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




1) Generate: Happens passively on your part, but it's good to know how it works in your field.
2) Plan: Devise a protocol for your data: fields, metadata, how it's going to be collected, etc.
3) Collect: Actually go out and get the data. Ensure the process is sound, no unintended bias.
4) Process: Make sure the data is formatted correctly, all correct metadata is assigned, and goes through whatever transformations are necessary
5) Analyze: Do your analysis.
6) Discuss: Discussion phase of a research paper
