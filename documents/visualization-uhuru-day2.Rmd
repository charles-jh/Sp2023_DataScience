## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r eval =TRUE}
acacia <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/ACACIA_DREPANOLOBIUM_SURVEY.txt", 
                   sep = "\t",
                   na.strings = 'dead')

```

```{r}
head(acacia)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = acacia, mapping = aes(x = HEIGHT, y = FRUITS, color = ANT)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ANT)
```
