## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Sequential Code

```{r}
numbers <- -300:546
numbers <- 1:300
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)
sqrt(x = numbers_mean)
```


## Nested Code
```{r}
numbers <- 1:300
mean(numbers)
sqrt(mean(numbers))
```
## Piping code
implement with 'magrittr'
```{r}
library(magrittr)
```
pipe symbol is %>% or |
```{r}
1:300 %>% mean() %>% sqrt()
```

```{r}
surveys <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/surveys.csv")
str(surveys)
```

```{r}
surveys$year %>% mean()
```

```{r}
surveys$weight %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
surveys1 <- select(surveys, year, month, day, species_id)
```

```{r}
surveys2 <- select(surveys, year, species_id, weight) %>% filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
mutate(weight_kg = weight/1000) %>% select(year, species_id, weight_kg)
head(surveys2)
```
