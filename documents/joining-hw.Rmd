## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
plots <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/plots.csv")
species <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/species.csv")
surveys <- read.csv(file = "../data-raw/surveys.csv")
View(plots)
View(species)
View(surveys)
```

Create a data frame with only data for the “species_id” “DO”, with the columns "year", "month", "day", "species_id", and "weight".

```{r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "DO") %>% 
  select("year", "month", "day", "species_id", "weight") ->
  filter_df
  View(filter_df)
```

Create a data frame with only data for species IDs "PP" and "PB" and for years starting in 1995, with the columns "year", "species_id", and "hindfoot_length", with no missing values for "hindfoot_length".

```{r}
filter(surveys, species_id == "PP" | species_id == "PB" | year == "1995") %>% 
  select("year", "species_id", "hindfoot_length") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) ->
  filter_hl
  View(filter_hl)
```

Create a data frame with the average "hindfoot_length" for each "species_id" in each "year" with no null values.
```{r}
surveys %>% filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>% 
  group_by(species_id, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean(hindfoot_length))
```
group()





```{r}
inner_join(surveys, plots, by = "plot_id") %>% 
  inner_join(species, by = "species_id") %>% 
  filter(taxa == "Rodent") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  filter(plot_type == "Control" | plot_type == "Long term Krat Exclosure") %>% 
  select("year", "genus", "species", "weight", "plot_type")
```
